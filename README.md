# IoT-based-Smart-Home-System
Voice-Controlled Smart Home Using Arduino This project lets you control a LED and a servo motor (for a door) with voice commands using Python and Arduino. The Python script listens, sends commands to the Arduino, and controls the devices via serial communication. Itâ€™s expandable for more smart home applications.
